# Fairy_Invasion
A game similar to space invaders, but with less elements to it.

This game was created with the help of the book "Python Crash Course".  I followed a similar structure but modified a lot as I went on to learn and play with it.
I added sound and moved the position of the scoreboard around.  There are many ways to enhance this project, but this was the first thing I created, but it was entirely guided by that book by Eric Matthes.
